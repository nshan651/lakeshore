# Lakeshore
 
The Lakeshore Programming Language.

Lakeshore is based on Scala but with a LLVM back-end.

## Design

1. Lexer
    - Tokenize source code
2. Parser
    - Build a parser to create an AST from the tokens generated by the lexer
3. Semantic Analysis
4. Intermediate Representation (IR)
    - Translate your AST into LLVM IR. LLVM IR is a low-level, platform-independent representation that LLVM can optimize and generate machine code from.
